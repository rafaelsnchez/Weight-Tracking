# Weight-Tracking
Weight Tracking App

I have chosen to work on an app that will be used to track the daily weight. The app will consist of a database consisting of at least three tables to store the userâ€™s daily weight, authentication information, and goal weight. The app will have a screen that greets the user with a login screen and a grid that displays all the daily weights and the days they were entered to display the information. Within the app, there will also be mechanisms for the add their daily weight, add a goal weight, and a mechanism by which the application will notify the user whenthey reach their goal weight.I took simplicitic approach when adding the features for adding the users weight to the database. I wanted to ensure users interacted with the app, but also avoid creating an extensive process to add and track their weight. After completing the design and logic I ran each class individually to ensure proper functionality before runing the app as a whole. Creating the logic for the application may have the most difficult aspect of the process. However with the android documentation, along with trial and error I was able to overcome my inexperience and complete the app. I enjoyed this journey on my first android application.
